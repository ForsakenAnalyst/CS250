How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
ANSWER: As a developer I want to create the best possible product for the user. With that being said, I need to be able to fully interpret the user needs and translate them into a form that is better suited for developers. Creating user stories helps with this by outlining what functions the user requires from a system, and then breaking down that function into smaller parts that can be developed and integrated to create the larger overall feature. 

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
ANSWER: I would like to think that I approach developing programs by first breaking everything down into smaller, more manageable pieces. I first take a look and what the overall problem is and then think of ways to break it down to solve the bigger puzzle. There are certain agile processes I hope to employ in my future developement that help me break things down, such as the product backlog, user stories, and information radiators. I also really like the focus on iteration that the agile methodology adheres to as I think it helps create a better overall product. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
To me, being a good team member in software development means knowing your craft, and if you dont know something, be humble enough to ask for help and be willing to give help when youre asked for it. Be open with your team memebers on issues you are having and things you are running into because they may also be running into similar issues. Set due dates and goals for yourself and stick to them, and if youre in a leadership position, do the same for your team. Be open, and honest, and look for ways to integrate your skills into the team.
